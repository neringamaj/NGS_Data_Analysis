<h1>NGS Data Analysis for Bacterial Identification</h1>

<h2>Repository Description</h2>
<p>
    This repository contains a Python script for the analysis of next-generation sequencing data obtained from a sample collected from a toilet handle. The primary focus of this script is to process FASTQ files, determine quality encoding, analyze nucleotide distribution, and identify bacterial species through sequence alignment.
</p>

<h2>Code Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quality Encoding Detection:</strong> Automatically detects the quality score encoding used in FASTQ files from various sequencing platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>CG Distribution Analysis:</strong> Analyzes and visualizes the distribution of C/G nucleotides across sequencing reads.</li>
    <li><strong>Bacterial Sequence Identification:</strong> Performs BLAST searches on selected sequences to identify bacterial species present in the sample.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Biopython Library</li>
    <li>NCBI BLAST+ command line tools</li>
</ul>
